# Sorting-Algorithms | CAB301 A2
> A testing and analysis tool for the time complexity and number of basic operations of two Median algorithms for CAB301 - Algorithms & Complexity

## Context:
Both Median Algorithms were provided by the unit and were derived from the following well known algorithms.
* `selection sort`
* `quick-sort`

The task was to write a testing environment to experimentally measure its complexity in relation to time and number of basic operations.

### Usage:
As it currently sits, the timing method will be inaccurate because it measures the time for the algorithm to run, with resources shared with the basic operations counter. For best results, these counters need to be commented out, for a timer run.
